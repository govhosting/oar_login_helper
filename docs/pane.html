<h3>Notice for beta testing â€“ do not use real AusGovBoards board member data</h3>
<p>
    OAR is currently in the beta testing stage and is not the source of truth of data for AGOR, AusGovBoards or Directory. Due to the sensitivity of personal AusGovBoards board member data, actual board member data will not be loaded into this system for testing purposes. During your testing, do not replicate actual board member data from the current AusGovBoards system and instead create dummy data when creating board members and board roles.
